I've thoroughly reviewed both session records. The key unresolved remaining task is:
Issue I6: DrizzleAdapter Build Error — The lazy proxy db fails the adapter's type/constructor checks during Next.js's static collection phase because the adapter evaluates the database at build time, not runtime.
Key conclusion from review:
- The lazy proxy pattern is incompatible with DrizzleAdapter because the adapter initializes at module load time.
- Recommended fix: Use a direct, eager DrizzlePgDatabase connection instead of the proxy, or create a factory-based adapter initialization that defers until runtime.
Summary of what was accomplished:
- Schema fully defined and migrated.
- Auth infrastructure mostly built, but blocked by the adapter connection issue.
- Auth.js v5 beta session augmentation (types/next-auth.d.ts) still needs to be created.
My plan to complete the remaining tasks:
1. Fix db/index.ts — Replace the lazy proxy with a module that provides a real DrizzlePgDatabase eagerly if DATABASE_URL is available at build time, while maintaining a safe fallback to prevent build crashes. This is the correct long-term approach for Next.js 16 + Drizzle.
2. Create types/next-auth.d.ts — Augment auth.js v5 sessions with id and role fields.
3. Re-run build verification — Ensure next build succeeds and tsc --noEmit passes.
4. Verify migrations — Re-apply if necessary.
Let's proceed with the implementation.
Step 1: Fix src/lib/db/index.ts — Eager db connection with build safety
The problem: DrizzleAdapter checks the db object's type at import time, and a Proxy can't satisfy type checks. Since the session reports state .env.local is present with DATABASE_URL, the database connection is available at build time.
Solution: Make the database connection eager (not lazy), but gracefully handle the case where DATABASE_URL is undefined (e.g., during static analysis or in CI without env). The simplest safe approach is to attempt creating the postgres client and drizzle instance at the top level. If DATABASE_URL is missing, log a clear error but don't crash Next.js's build (build is a Node process, not an render). Actually, Next.js build runs the full stack, and if DATABASE_URL is present in .env.local, the build will have it.
However, a more robust approach for Next.js: avoid the global proxy and instead provide a getDb() function that creates the db if needed, ensuring DrizzleAdapter(db) in src/lib/auth/index.ts receives a real instance. But DrizzleAdapter is called at the module level in src/lib/auth/index.ts.
The best fix, aligned with Next.js 16 + Drizzle best practices, is to make the connection eager but with robust error handling:       Let me fix the DrizzleAdapter build error by modifying src/lib/db/index.ts to use a real database instance instead of a lazy proxy:
→Read src/lib/db/index.ts 
Let me fix this. The issue is that DrizzleAdapter checks the type/constructor of db at module import time, and the Proxy can't satisfy those checks. I'll replace the lazy proxy with an direct database instance that's safe for Next.js 16 + Drizzle. We have .env.local with DATABASE_URL, so the connection is available at build time.
Actually, the real fix for Next.js 16 + Drizzle is to make the db connection eager but wrapped in error handling so it doesn't crash the build if DATABASE_URL is missing. Since we confirmed .env.local exists with the URL, the build should succeed.
Let me write the corrected version: </think>
# Wrote src/lib/db/index.ts
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import postgres from "postgres";
import * as schema from "./schema";

// [DEPLOYMENT NOTE] max: 10 assumes a DEDICATED Node.js runtime
// (Docker, Railway, AWS ECS). Serverless platforms (Vercel, Lambda)
// will exhaust PostgreSQL max_connections rapidly.
// For serverless, swap to a connection pooler (PgBouncer or Supavisor).
function createClient(url: string) {
  return postgres(url, {
    max: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? 10 : 3,
    idle_timeout: 20,
    connect_timeout: 10,
  });
}

function createDb(client: ReturnType<typeof postgres>) {
  return drizzle(client, {
    schema,
    logger: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
  });
}

const url = process.env.DATABASE_URL;

if (!url) {
  console.warn("[DB] DATABASE_URL is not set. Database queries will fail.");
}

const client = url ? createClient(url) : ({} as ReturnType<typeof postgres>);

export const db = url
  ? createDb(client)
  : ({} as ReturnType<typeof createDb>);

Good, now let me verify the schema is correct and the auth index file is using it properly: </think>  Now let me check the auth configuration and other related files to verify they work with the real db instance:
→Read src/lib/auth/index.ts 
The auth configuration looks good. The db import is used with DrizzleAdapter. With the non-proxy db export, the adapter should be able to detect the proper type. Let me also create the next-auth.d.ts for session augmentation since it's still missing per the session summary, and then run the build to verify. </think>   Now I need to create the types/next-auth.d.ts for Auth.js v5 session augmentation, and also verify that the schema has the verificationTokens table exported:
→Read src/lib/db/schema.ts [limit=50]
Let me check the rest of the schema for verificationTokens:
✱Grep "verificationTokens|verification_tokens" in src/lib/db (2 matches)
Good. Now let me check that verificationTokens is being exported and used correctly. I also need to create the types/next-auth.d.ts file to augment the session. Let me also verify the auth Dal and any other auth files.   Good. Now I need to create the types/next-auth.d.ts for session augmentation and verify the auth DAL:
→Read src/lib/auth/dal.ts 
The auth DAL looks good. Now let me create the types/next-auth.d.ts for session augmentation and also check if the types directory exists:    Good. Now I'll create the NextAuth types augmentation and then run the build to verify everything works:
# Check if types directory exists
$ ls /home/project/onestopnews/types/
ls: cannot access '/home/project/onestopnews/types/': No such file or directory
I need to create the types directory and the next-auth.d.ts file. Also I should verify what exactly needs to be augmented for NextAuth v5 beta. Let me create the file and then run the build to check.   Let me create the types directory and the NextAuth augmentation:      I need to create the types/next-auth.d.ts for session augmentation. Let me also verify the auth configuration is using the correct imports and the as void casts are safe:
# Create types directory
$ mkdir -p /home/project/onestopnews/types
