## Key Decisions & Fixes

### CSS Subgrid for Feed
The static mockup declared CSS subgrid (`grid-rows-subgrid`) for the feed, but the existing `FeedGrid.tsx` already implements a clean card grid. The subgrid implementation would require a significant refactor of the existing feed architecture. For incremental delivery, subgrid was deferred to a future optimization phase.

### `next/image` External Host
The static mockup uses `https://picsum.photos` for the lead story image. Next.js 16 requires external image domains to be whitelisted in `next.config.ts` via `images.remotePatterns`. This was added.

### `cat-label` Typography
The static mockup uses a custom `cat-label` class (`font-variant: all-small-caps`) not available in Tailwind. This was added to `globals.css` as a standard utility class.

### Scroll Progress Indicator
The static mockup includes a CSS-only scroll progress bar at the top. This requires `animation-timeline: scroll()` which is supported in Chromium but not Firefox. Since progressive enhancement is a principle, this was kept but gracefully degrades when `animation-timeline` is unavailable.

---

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. **Subgrid**: Implement `grid-rows-subgrid` for the feed cards (matches mockup)
2. **Reveal Animations**: Add Intersection Observer-based reveal-on-scroll to all sections
3. **Dark Mode**: The static mockup's CTA section uses a dark background but no full dark theme exists
4. **Load More**: Implement cursor-based `Load More` button for feed pagination
5. **E2E Tests**: Add Playwright tests for the full user journey (feed → article → summary)
6. **Performance**: Add `next/image` priority loading for Lead Story image

---

## Known Issues
- `src/features/feed/queries.test.ts` — One pre-existing test failure (`cacheLife()` requires `cacheComponents` config, which is set but the test runner doesn't have the Next.js production context). This was present before any changes.
