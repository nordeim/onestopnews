Here is Part 3 of the consolidated OneStopNews Master Project Architecture Document (PAD) v2.0.
This section covers the definitive component designs, operational procedures, testing strategy, risk register, and deployment checklist.
PART III: COMPONENT DESIGN
7. Authentication & Authorization
7.1 3-Layer Defense-in-Depth Model
Layer
Location
Purpose
Rule
Layer 1 (UX)
proxy.ts
Optimistic redirect for unauthenticated users hitting /admin/*
NOT a security boundary. No DB calls. Cookie presence check only.
Layer 2 (Route)
app/(admin)/layout.tsx
Session validation & RBAC enforcement
Calls auth.api.getSession(). Redirects to /sign-in if invalid.
Layer 3 (Server Action)
features/*/actions.ts
Mutations require explicit authorization
Verifies session.user.role === 'admin' before executing any domain logic.
7.2 Better Auth & Session Schema
Better Auth manages session lifecycle. The following Drizzle tables must exist in the schema for the database adapter to function, but direct writes are prohibited (use auth.api.* methods).
typescript
123456789101112131415161718192021222324
8. Ingestion Pipeline
8.1 Ingestion Job Handler (bullmq ingest queue)
typescript
123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384
8.2 Importance Scoring Algorithm
Scoring runs in the score queue after ingestion. Weights are fixed and auditable.
typescript
123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233
9. AI Summarization Pipeline
9.1 Prompt Construction & Content Assembly
typescript
1234567
9.2 Dual-Model Strategy & Fallback
Primary: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022. Fallback: gpt-4o-mini.
typescript
12345678910111213
9.3 Source-Cited Disclosure Enforcement
Critical Trust Requirement: The AI response must be validated by Zod before database insertion. If validation fails, the job retries with a strict system prompt or marks summaryStatus: 'needs_review'.
typescript
1234567891011
10. Search & Caching Architecture
10.1 FTS Query Builder (Production)
typescript
1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526
10.2 Autocomplete (pg_trgm)
typescript
123456789101112131415
10.3 Phase 2 BM25 Migration Path

10.4 Cache Invalidation Taxonomy
Trigger
Method
Scope
Use Case
User Mutation
revalidateTag(tag, { type: 'layout' })
Immediate
Read-your-writes after Server Action
Worker Completion
revalidateTag(tag, { maxAge: 'max' })
Background
Feed refresh after ingestion/scoring
Admin Action
revalidatePath('/admin/*')
Immediate
Source CRUD, category updates
Cache Component

PART IV: OPERATIONS & DELIVERY

11.1 Docker Compose

11.2 init.sql (DB Bootstrap)

12. Environment Variable Schema
Validated via Zod at application startup. Missing/invalid vars cause immediate exit.
typescript
12345678910111213141516
13. Observability & Alerting
Structured Logging: JSON format, includes correlationId, jobId, sourceId, durationMs.
Metrics Exposed: Queue depth (bullmq:ingest:depth), job duration histograms, AI token usage counters, DB pool utilization %.
Alert Rules (PagerDuty/Slack):
sourceHealth.consecutiveFailures > 3 for Tier-1 source
queue.summarize.depth > 500 for > 15 minutes
db.pool.active_connections > 80% of max_connections
ai.error_rate > 5% over 5-minute window
14. Operational Runbooks
🔴 Runbook 1: Ingestion Source Failure
Identify: Check sourceHealthSnapshots or BullMQ failed jobs.
Diagnose: curl -I <source.feedUrl> (check HTTP status, robots.txt, SSL expiry).
Mitigate:
If 429/Rate-Limited: Increase pollIntervalMinutes, add exponential backoff.
If 403/Blocked: Rotate User-Agent, check if source moved to paywall.
If Feed Broken: Admin marks sources.isActive = false. Manual feed URL update.
Recover: await ingestQueue.upsertJobScheduler(...) to restart polling. Clear consecutive failures in DB.
🔴 Runbook 2: AI Summarization Incident
Identify: summarize queue depth spikes. failed jobs show ZodError or RateLimitError.
Diagnose: Check Anthropic/OpenAI status pages. Verify API keys in env.
Mitigate:
If API Down: Toggle summaryStatus to pending in DB. Queue will retry on backoff.
If Hallucination Rate High: Update prompt template version, set needs_review for recent outputs.
Recover: Restart workers. Run drizzle-kit to verify summaries schema matches prompt expectations.
🔴 Runbook 3: Database Connection Exhaustion
Identify: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections.
Diagnose: SELECT count(*), state FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY state;
Mitigate:
Scale down Worker concurrency immediately (summarize → 2, ingest → 10).
Verify Lazy Proxy pattern is active (lib/db/index.ts).
If Web App is leaking connections: Deploy hotfix, clear Next.js server cache.
Recover: Restart Postgres (if self-hosted) or scale up instance. Re-enable worker concurrency.

Env schema validates successfully on target environment
drizzle-kit generate produces clean, additive SQL migration
Queue depth < 100 pending jobs (drain if necessary)
Feature flags set to false for untested components
Backup taken (DB snapshot + Redis AOF dump)
🚀 Deploy
Database Migration: Run tsx scripts/migrate.ts (pre-deploy step)
Worker Rollout: Deploy Node.js worker service first (backward-compatible job schema)
Web App Rollout: Deploy Next.js 16 app (PPR cache warm, edge invalidation)
Cache Warm: Trigger revalidateTag for top 10 categories
Queue Re-sync: Run bootstrapScheduler() to ensure idempotent cron alignment
🔍 Post-Deploy
Health endpoint returns 200 OK with DB & Redis connectivity
Playwright smoke tests pass on production URL
BullMQ dashboard shows ingest & summarize queues processing normally
Structured logs show 0 errors in first 15 minutes
AI token usage & cost projection within expected baseline

End of Part 3.
This concludes the OneStopNews Master Project Architecture Document (PAD) v2.0. The document is now fully consolidated, strictly aligned with PRD v2.0, and production-ready for engineering execution. All contradictions have been resolved, critical patterns have been preserved, and operational guardrails are explicitly defined.
