## Key Discovery: Existing Implementation Already Exists

The clipboard file (upload #4) contains a **complete, production-ready static HTML landing page** (~62,231 chars) with:
- Full "Editorial Dispatch" design system implemented
- Wire ticker with breaking headlines
- Masthead with edition bar and LIVE pulse
- Sticky category navigation ribbon
- Lead story (asymmetric 7:5 grid)
- Asymmetric story grid (7-5-4-4-4 spans)
- AI Summary Demo with interactive tabs, citations, confidence bar, accordion
- How It Works (3-step pipeline)
- Search & Speed section
- Trust section (dark, 5 commitments)
- CTA + Footer
- Full JavaScript interactivity (tabs, accordion, category nav, sort buttons)
- Tailwind CSS v4 via CDN + Google Fonts + Lucide icons

**Critical implication:** The user may want an **enhanced/refined version** of this existing page, not a from-scratch build.

## Research Conducted (6 Dimensions)

| Dimension | Key Finding | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1. News aggregator UI trends 2026 | "Resonant Stark" (emotional minimalism), bold typography as foundation, micro-interactions as core UI language, technical mono accents, spatial design | web_search results |
| 2. Editorial dispatch aesthetic | Wire-service terminal aesthetic; high-contrast ink/paper; monospace metadata; asymmetric grids | web_search results |
| 3. 2026 design trends | Overused animations clutter UI; bold eye-catching fonts improve usability; personalization defines UX; Material 3 Expressive research | web_search results |
| 4. OneStopNews specific | No existing product found — greenfield design opportunity | web_search results |
| 5. Anti-generic enforcement | Reject bento grids, purple gradients, Inter/Roboto safety, predictable card grids, "AI slop" aesthetic | super-frontend-design-skill.md |
| 6. Accessibility | WCAG AAA target, ADA Title II compliance (federally required April 2026), prefers-reduced-motion | PRD + skill file |

## Design Direction: "Editorial Dispatch" → Refined as "Ink & Signal"

| Aspect | Original Clipboard | Planned Enhancement |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Aesthetic core** | Warm editorial (paper tones) | **"Ink & Signal"** — high-contrast editorial with analog/digital tension |
| **Typography** | Newsreader + Space Grotesk + JetBrains Mono | **Instrument Serif** (display) + Space Grotesk (UI) + JetBrains Mono (metadata) |
| **Color system** | Warm neutrals with dispatch accents | **High-contrast ink/paper** with signal-colored category accents |
| **Hero strategy** | Lead story IS the hero | **Asymmetric editorial masthead** — massive typography + live signal |
| **Motion** | Basic hover transitions | **Scroll-triggered reveals** + refined micro-interactions |
| **AI Summary Demo** | Static tab switch | **Interactive citation hover** + confidence animation + accordion |
| **Trust section** | Dark background with commitments | **Full-bleed ink section** with numbered editorial commitments |

4. LEAD STORY — Full editorial block (hero IS the news)
5. STORY GRID — Asymmetric card grid (7-5-4-4-4 spans)
6. THICK RULE — Newspaper-style section break
7. CONCEPT INTRO — "Why OneStopNews" editorial manifesto
8. AI SUMMARY DEMO — Interactive tabbed panel with citations
9. HOW IT WORKS — 3-step pipeline: Ingest → Organize → Distill
10. SEARCH & SPEED — BM25 search + performance metrics
11. TRUST (INK) — Full-bleed dark section; 5 commitments

## Typography System (Planned)

| Role | Font | Weight | Size Range | Line Height |
|------|------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Display / H1 | Instrument Serif | 400–700 | 48–72px | 1.05 |
| H2 / Section | Instrument Serif | 400–600 | 32–48px | 1.1 |

## Animation Strategy (Purposeful Motion Only)

| Element | Animation | Duration | Easing | Trigger |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Ticker | Infinite horizontal scroll | 80s | linear | Page load |
| LIVE dot | Opacity pulse | 2s | ease-in-out | Infinite |
| Section reveals | Fade-up + translateY(20→0) | 600ms | cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1) | Scroll intersection |
| Card hover | translateY(-4px) + shadow | 180ms | ease-out | Hover |
| Tab switch | Content cross-fade | 200ms | ease | Click |
| Confidence bar | Width grow 0→87% | 800ms | cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1) | Scroll into view |
| Accordion | max-height expand | 300ms | cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1) | Click |

**Reduced Motion:** All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

---

## Technical Implementation Plan

- **Format:** Single self-contained HTML file
- **Dependencies:** Google Fonts (Instrument Serif, Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono) + Tailwind CSS v4 CDN + Lucide icons CDN
- **No build step:** Open directly in browser
- **CSS:** Embedded `<style>` with Tailwind v4 `@theme` directives
- **JS:** Embedded `<script>` — vanilla JS, no frameworks

---

## Validation Checklist (Pre-Delivery)

| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Anti-Generic | No bento grids, no purple gradients, no Inter/Roboto, no stock-photo hero |
| Typography Hierarchy | Squint test passes — clear hierarchy without color |
| Color Contrast | All text meets WCAG AAA (7:1 minimum) |
| Responsive | Functional at 320px, 768px, 1440px+ |
| Motion | All animations serve comprehension; reduced-motion respected |
| Interactivity | Tabs, accordion, category nav, sort buttons all functional |
| Semantic HTML | Proper landmarks, headings, ARIA labels |
| Performance | Single file, minimal dependencies, optimized images |

## Outstanding Task: Phase 4 — IMPLEMENTATION

The planning is complete and validated. The user approved the plan with "approved, please proceed meticulously." The next step is to:

1. **Write the complete HTML file** incorporating all planned enhancements over the existing clipboard implementation
2. **Apply the "Ink & Signal" aesthetic** with Instrument Serif typography
3. **Implement scroll-triggered animations** using Intersection Observer
4. **Build the interactive AI Summary Demo** with full citation system
5. **Ensure WCAG AAA compliance** throughout
6. **Save to `/mnt/agents/output/`** and provide download link

---

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Instrument Serif over Newsreader** | More distinctive editorial voice; better stroke contrast |
| **"Ink & Signal" over warm editorial** | Higher contrast, more memorable, better anti-generic differentiation |
| **Single HTML file deliverable** | Zero build tools; maximum portability; immediate browser preview |
| **Enhancement over rewrite** | Preserve proven structure from clipboard; elevate aesthetics and interactions |
| **Scroll-triggered reveals** | 2026 trend (spatial design); purposeful motion serving comprehension |
| **Confidence bar animation** | Demonstrates AI transparency (core PRD requirement) |

## User Communication Pattern

- User provides "continue" repeatedly to extend output
- User expects meticulous, structured responses with clear phase gates
- User values anti-generic, avant-garde design with full reasoning
- User approved plan without modifications — proceed to implementation

---

## Next Action Required

**Execute Phase 4: IMPLEMENTATION** — Build the complete enhanced HTML file with all planned improvements and save to output directory.
