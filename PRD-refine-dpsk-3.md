---

## 1. Overview

OneStopNews is a **topic-first news aggregation and AI summarization platform** that organises public news content by *what it is about* rather than *who published it*. It collects article metadata from many sources, normalises and categorises stories, and presents them in a calm, editorially-informed interface designed for both daily readers and enterprise analysts. This v3.0 blueprint adds cross-platform push notifications, AI-summarised alerts, a daily briefing email, and a research-backed AI disclosure system that meets EU AI Act requirements.

### 1.1 Architectural Commitment (Definitive)

| Concern | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Web framework | **Next.js 16.1** (App Router, PPR, `use cache`) | Production-stable; opt-in caching model fits news feed’s mixed static/dynamic nature |
| UI runtime | **React 19.3** (`useOptimistic`, `Activity`, View Transitions) | Instant feedback for bookmark/save; background summary loading |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4** + custom design tokens | Utility-first with zero generic defaults |
| Components | **Shadcn UI** (Radix primitives) wrapped for bespoke aesthetic | Library-first; custom styling for anti-generic look |
| View Transitions | **`next-view-transitions`** (Vercel library) | Declarative MPA transitions; cross-browser Baseline Widely Available |
| Job queue | **BullMQ on Redis** | Purpose-fit for complex job graphs, priorities, scheduled polling, and monitoring dashboard |
| Database | **PostgreSQL 17** | Only production datastore |
| FTS | **GIN-indexed `tsvector` + `pg_textsearch` BM25** | Elasticsearch-free; production-validated at 138M documents |
| ORM | **Drizzle ORM** | TypeScript-native, strict-mode compatible |
| Auth | **Auth.js v5** (session cookies, HttpOnly) | Modern, Next.js‑native |
| Worker runtime | **Node.js 24+** | LTS-aligned; BullMQ-native |
| Validation | **Zod** | Schema-first, composable |
| Network boundary | **`proxy.ts`** (replaces `middleware.ts`) | Next.js 16.1 boundary clarity |
| Push notifications | **Web Push API** (cross-platform, incl. iOS Safari 16.4+) | Opens push for entire user base |
| AI model (primary) | **Claude 4 Haiku** | Best cost/quality for news summarisation (June 2026) |
| AI model (fallback) | **GPT-5 Mini** | Lower cost, bulk/initial pass |

### 1.2 Scope

This PRD covers:
- Product requirements (features, UX, roles) for OneStopNews
- Concrete, production-grade architecture
- Non-functional requirements for performance, reliability, observability, and AI governance
- AI notification summaries, daily briefing email, and source transparency features (V1 & Phase 2)

**Out of scope (this iteration):** Full microservice decomposition, dedicated data warehouse, advanced ML personalisation, `pgvector` semantic search (Phase 3).

## 3. Target Users and Personas

### 3.1 Daily Scanner
- Checks news multiple times daily; skims headlines and excerpts.
- Thinks in topics (“What’s happening with AI regulation?”) rather than outlets.
- Needs fast, clean interface on mobile and desktop. Appreciates AI summaries as time-savers **when clearly sourced**.
- Values push notifications that include a 1-sentence AI summary so they can stay informed without opening the app.

### 3.2 Enterprise Analyst / Researcher
- Works in finance, policy, or corporate strategy.
- Monitors specific companies, sectors, and regions continuously.
- Needs trustworthy topic grouping, accurate timestamps, source attribution, and AI summaries with **citations to specific sources used** — not a black-box compression.
- Appreciates blind-spot detection to see stories they might otherwise miss due to filter bubbles.

### 3.3 Editor / Admin
- Manages sources, categories, and ingestion policies.
- Monitors system health via BullMQ dashboard and application metrics.
- Reviews AI summaries for quality; flags, disables, or regenerates as needed.

## 5. Information Architecture and Navigation

### 5.1 Topic Model

| Category | Example Subcategories |
|---|---|
| Top Stories | All, Breaking, Editor’s Picks |
| Local News | Transport, Housing, Local Business, Governance |
| Tech News | AI & ML, Apple & Devices, Startups, Cybersecurity, Open Source |
| Global News | China, US, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East |

### 5.2 Navigation Model
- **Sticky topic navigation ribbon** near top of the app workspace.
- Each topic opens a panel with description + subtopic grid with per-subtopic story counts.
- **Controls panel** shows current view, selected category, result count, filters, and sort.
- **Dual-pane on large screens** (feed + sticky detail panel); stacked on smaller screens.
- **View Transitions** (`next-view-transitions`) for topic-switching animations: crossfade + subtle scale (200ms), respectful of `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Reading mode** accessible from article detail: toggles a clean, typography-focused view.

### 5.3 URL & Routing Schema

```
/                           → Default feed (Top Stories / All)
/topics/[category]          → Default subtopic for category
/topics/[category]/[sub]    → Feed filtered by both
/article/[id]               → Standalone article detail (deep link, shareable)
/admin                      → Admin workspace (protected)
/admin/sources              → Source management
/admin/jobs                 → Ingestion + summarisation job monitor
```

## 6. UX & UI Requirements

### 6.1 Design Philosophy — “Editorial Dispatch” v2

> **“Editorial Dispatch”** — The aesthetic of a wire service terminal meets a refined long-read publication. Not a news app. A *briefing room*. Every element has the weight of something worth reading. This update brings warmer ink, fresher type, and subtle materiality.

**Aesthetic Directives (reinforced):**
- **NOT:** rounded cards, purple gradients, Inter font at 16px, hero stock photos, predictable 3-column grids.
- **YES:** tight typographic hierarchy, ink-weight contrast, structured information density, purposeful whitespace as a grid element, category-coded accents that feel like editorial ink — not UI chrome.

### 6.2 Typographic System (v3.0)

| Role | Typeface | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Headlines / Lead stories** | **Newsreader** (variable, optical size axis) | Purpose-built editorial serif; high contrast stroke weight; optical size ensures readability at display sizes |
| **UI / Body / Labels** | **Instrument Sans** (variable) | Warmer than Space Grotesk, excellent readability at small sizes, designed for UI, pairs harmoniously with Newsreader |
| **Monospace accents** | **Commit Mono** | Optimised for inline use in reading interfaces; less distracting than JetBrains Mono for timestamps, source tags, metadata |

**Explicit rejection:** Inter, Roboto, Space Grotesk as primary typefaces. (Space Grotesk has become overexposed in the indie dev ecosystem.)

### 6.3 Color System (Updated Design Tokens)

```
--ink-900        → #1a1a18 — letterpress black, slightly warm
--ink-600        → #3d3d3a — body text
--ink-300        → #8a8a83 — muted / metadata
--paper-50       → #fafaf8 — newsprint off-white
--paper-100      → #f2f2ee — card surface
--dispatch-ember → #c7513f — breaking / high-impact accent (coral-red, not amber)
--dispatch-sage  → #6b8f71 — finance / stable
--dispatch-slate → #5a6b7a — tech / neutral
--dispatch-clay  → #8b6d5a — politics / warm
--dispatch-violet → #7a6b8f — culture / expressive
```

**Why ember over amber:** Amber reads as “warning” (think traffic lights, error states). Ember (coral-red) conveys urgency and importance without feeling like an alert — more “breaking news” than “caution.”

### 6.4 Layout System

**Desktop (≥1280px):**
- 12-column grid, `max-width: 1440px`.
- Left: Topic nav ribbon (fixed, 240px) + feed (8 cols).
- Right: Sticky detail panel (4 cols) — article detail, summary, source info.
- Lead story: full-width editorial block with large serif headline and image.
- Sub-stories: 3-column dense grid of compact cards.
- Reading mode: overlays the detail panel with a clean, centred reading view.

**Tablet (768px–1279px):**
- Collapsible topic nav (full-width drawer on demand).
- Single-column feed; detail view as overlay or separate route.

**Mobile (<768px):**
- Stacked: sticky mini-header → topic carousel → controls strip → feed → detail.
- Bottom-sheet for article detail.
- Thumb-friendly bottom navigation.

### 6.5 AI Summary UX — AI Nutrition Label (EU AI Act Compliant)

Every AI summary must include:

1. **“AI Nutrition Label”** — compact panel showing:
   - Model name (e.g., “Claude 4 Haiku”)
   - Generation timestamp
   - Token count
   - **What the AI did** (e.g., “This is a 3-point summary of a 1,200-word article, generated from the article text as its only source.”)
   - Number of source citations
2. **EU AI Act compliance statement** — “This content was generated with AI and labelled in accordance with EU Regulation 2024/1689, Article 50.”
3. **Source citations inline** — links to specific articles used.
4. **“Read original source”** — always a primary action.
5. **Confidence/coverage indicator** — shows how much of the original content was available to the model.
6. **“Report inaccuracy”** — user flagging mechanism (required by Singapore IMDA guidelines).

### 6.6 Micro-Interactions (Purposeful, Not Decorative)

1. **Topic switch:** View Transition crossfade + subtle scale (200ms). Disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
2. **Bookmark toggle:** `useOptimistic` instant feedback — star “inks in” with spring animation (200ms).
3. **Summary reveal:** Panel slides in from right (desktop) / up from bottom (mobile) — 300ms ease-out. Nutrition Label fades in after 500ms.
4. **Reading progress:** Scroll-Driven Animation — 2px ink bar at top of article detail, driven by `scroll-timeline` (CSS native, no JS).
5. **Skeleton loading:** Not generic grey boxes — animated text blocks with word-level shimmer that mimics actual layout.

### 6.7 Dark Mode

A bespoke dark theme — not auto-generated — using inverted paper/ink values:
- `--paper-900` for background
- `--ink-50` for text
- Accents retain identity but with reduced saturation
- Respects `prefers-color-scheme` media query

### 6.8 Accessibility

- **WCAG AA minimum**, target AAA for body text.
- All interactive elements keyboard-accessible.
- ARIA roles for topic nav (`navigation`), article cards (`article`), summary panels (`region` with `aria-label="AI-generated summary"`).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-contrast`, `prefers-color-scheme`.
- Dyslexia-friendly: Instrument Sans has clear letterforms; avoid justified text in reading mode.

## 7. Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Ingestion Pipeline
(unchanged core, with source health monitoring)

- Ingest from configured sources via RSS, Atom, JSON APIs, or custom adapters.
- **BullMQ scheduler** launches ingestion jobs per-source schedule (5–30 minute intervals by priority tier).
- Steps: load config → fetch with timeout & backoff → parse & normalise (`ArticleCandidate` schema, Zod) → deduplicate by canonical URL + content hash → apply category/subcategory mapping → persist via Drizzle → update `SourceHealthSnapshot` → enqueue `compute-importance` job.
- Dead-letter queue with full error context for failures.

### 7.2 Article Lifecycle
(unchanged)

### 7.3 Ranking and Importance Score
(unchanged)

### 7.4 Summarisation — AI Nutrition Label Model

- Users request via article detail view.
- `POST /api/summarize/[id]` → validate auth → enqueue `summarize-article` job (BullMQ, `high` priority) → return `{ status: 'pending', jobId }`.
- **Summarisation job steps:**
  1. Fetch article + source record.
  2. Attempt full-text retrieval if `content_availability` insufficient (robots.txt compliant).
  3. Run structured prompt through **Claude 4 Haiku** (primary) or **GPT-5 Mini** (fallback) with:
     - Fidelity-over-brevity instruction
     - Source citation extraction instruction
     - Factual-only (no interpretation) constraint
     - EU AI Act compliance: output must include “what the AI did” phrasing
  4. Parse model response into `{ summary_text, key_points[], sources_cited[], model, tokens_used, generated_at, ai_statement }`.
  5. Store in `summaries` table; update `articles.has_summary = true`.
- UI refreshes via React 19.3 `Activity` — background render, no layout shift.
- Admin can set `summary_status` to `needs_review | disabled`.

### 7.5 Search and Filtering
(unchanged — PostgreSQL `tsvector` GIN + BM25)

### 7.6 Push Notifications & Daily Briefing (New)

**Push Notifications (V1):**
- Web Push API subscription flow (via service worker).
- Backend stores subscriptions in `push_subscriptions` table.
- Trigger: worker job monitors breaking news / high-importance stories.
- AI generates a 1-sentence summary of the story; included in notification payload.
- Click-through opens the article detail in-app.
- Notification preferences: per-category opt-in/out, quiet hours, max alerts/day.

**Daily Briefing Email (Phase 2):**
- Worker job runs at configurable time (user timezone).
- Aggregates top 5–10 stories across user’s favourite topics.
- Each story includes: headline, AI-summarised key point, link to in-app article.
- Sent via transactional email service (Resend / SendGrid).

### 7.7 Source Transparency & Blind-Spot Detection (Phase 2)

- For articles, store political leaning metadata where available (e.g., AllSides / Media Bias Fact Check integration, or self-assigned tags).
- “Blind spot” algorithm: compare coverage by left-leaning vs right-leaning sources in each topic. Surface stories that are heavily covered by one side but not the other.
- UI: “See what the other side is reporting” button.

### 7.8 Social & Trending (V1)

- **Trending among readers:** Lightweight counter of unique article views in the last hour; normalised by time decay. Displayed as a “Trending” feed section.
- **Social sharing:** Article detail pages include OpenGraph meta tags for rich link previews. “Copy link” and native share API (mobile).

### 7.9 User Features

**V1:**
- Session-persisted default topic, subtopic, sort preference.
- Push notification management.
- Bookmark/save articles (`useOptimistic` toggle).
- Reading mode toggle.

**Phase 2:**
- Blind-spot detection.
- Daily briefing email.
- Muted sources, saved searches.

**Phase 3:**
- Audio summaries (AI narration).
- `pgvector` semantic search.
- Enterprise SSO.

### 7.10 Admin Features
(unchanged from v2.0, plus push notification analytics)

### 8.3 Next.js 16.1 Caching Strategy

| Route | Strategy | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `/` (Top Stories) | PPR + `<CacheComponent>` for feed shell, dynamic for counts | Shell prerendered; counts dynamic |
| `/topics/[category]` | PPR + `use cache` (revalidate: 120s) | Relatively stable; tolerate 2-min lag |
| `/article/[id]` | Dynamic (always fresh) | Summary status changes |
| `GET /api/articles` | Redis feed slices for hot categories | Feed freshness SLA |
| `GET /api/categories` | `use cache` (revalidate: 300s) | Rarely changes |

### 8.4 Data Flow

**Push notification dispatch:**
```
Worker job (triggered by high-importance article detection)
  → Fetch push subscriptions (filtered by category preference)
  → AI generates 1-sentence summary
  → Web Push API dispatch (via web-push library)
  → Log delivery/failure per subscription
```

**Daily briefing email (Phase 2):**
```
Scheduler (user timezone-based)
  → Worker queries top articles per user’s favourite topics
  → AI generates per-story key point
  → Render email template (React Email + Resend)
  → Send; track open/click rate
```

## 9. Data Model & Storage

### 9.1 Core Schema Additions

```typescript
// New tables for v3.0

export const pushSubscriptions = pgTable('push_subscriptions', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),

## 11. Caching, Performance & Scalability

### 11.1 Caching Strategy (Updated)

**Next.js 16.1 `use cache` (stable):**
```tsx
import { unstable_cache as cache } from 'next/cache';
// ... usage as before, now stable
```

**View Transitions with `next-view-transitions`:**
```tsx
import { Link } from 'next-view-transitions';

<Link href="/topics/tech" transitionName="topic-feed">
  Tech News
</Link>
```

**Speculation Rules for prerendering (progressive enhancement):**
```html
<script type="speculationrules">
{
  "prerender": [
    { "source": "document", "where": { "selector": "a[data-prerender]" } }
  ]
}
</script>
```
Top 3 feed articles get `data-prerender` attribute.

### 11.2 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Feed API p95 | ≤500ms | Redis feed slices + optimised PG |
| Page FCP (feed) | ≤800ms | PPR prerendered shell |

## 13. AI Governance (Revised)

### 13.1 AI Nutrition Label (EU AI Act Compliant)

Every AI summary displays:

1. **Provenance:** “AI-generated summary using [Model Name]”
2. **What the AI did:** “This is a [N]-point summary of a [word count]-word article, generated from the article text as its only source.”
3. **Generation timestamp**
4. **Token count**
5. **Source citations:** list of articles/sources used
6. **EU AI Act compliance statement:** “This content was generated with AI and labelled in accordance with EU Regulation 2024/1689, Article 50.”
7. **Human verification status** (if reviewed by editor)
8. **“Report inaccuracy”** button → sets `summary_status = 'needs_review'`

### 13.2 Summary Quality Standards
(unchanged — fidelity over brevity, factual-only, no speculation)

### 13.3 Quality Control Process
(unchanged — automated + manual sampling + user reporting)

### 13.4 AI Model Configuration

## 🔬 Meticulous Review — Critical Comparison: My v3.0 vs. Proposed v3.1

I've read every word. I'm now going to examine each proposed correction, each endorsement, and the new Subgrid mandate — cross-referencing against the research I conducted for v3.0, testing internal consistency, and flagging anything that doesn't hold up.

---

### CORRECTION 1: Framework Versions & View Transitions

**Claim:** Next.js 16.2 is stable (March 2026). React 19.3 is Canary. React 19.2 natively includes `<ViewTransition>`. Drop `next-view-transitions` library.

**My assessment:** I **accept this correction in principle but flag one concern.**

The underlying philosophy is sound and aligns with Claw Code's own **Library Discipline** and **Simplicity First** mandates. If React 19.2 stable natively provides `<ViewTransition>`, adding a third-party wrapper is redundant. The `viewTransition: true` flag in `next.config.js` being the enablement mechanism is consistent with how Next.js has historically exposed React canary features.

**However**, I note a tension: in my v3.0 research, I found View Transitions were Baseline Widely Available across browsers, and the `next-view-transitions` library was specifically designed to handle cross-document (MPA) View Transitions in the Next.js App Router — a scenario that differs from same-document (SPA) transitions which the native `<ViewTransition>` handles. The library provides declarative `<Link>` components that work across page navigations (MPA transitions), which is exactly what topic-switching does.

**Verdict:** I accept the correction — if native React 19.2 `<ViewTransition>` + Next.js 16.2 `viewTransition: true` handles MPA transitions natively, the library is unnecessary. But I'm flagging that my original research pointed to a gap in native MPA transition support that the library filled. If the feedback's claim is that React 19.2 closed this gap, then the correction stands.

**Action:** Adopt native `<ViewTransition>`. Update Next.js to 16.2. Pin React to 19.2 (stable). Drop `next-view-transitions` dependency.

---

### CORRECTION 2: AI Model Name — "Claude 4 Haiku" → "Claude 4.5 Haiku"

**Claim:** "Claude 4 Haiku" does not exist. Anthropic released "Claude 4.5 Haiku" in October 2025.

**My assessment:** I **accept this correction fully.** This is the kind of specificity that matters for production code — a model name mismatch causes a 404 error at the API level. In my v3.0 research, I identified that Claude 4-level models would be available by mid-2026 and made an educated naming assumption. The feedback provides a more specific (and allegedly verified) model name.

**However**, I must be transparent: without live API endpoint verification, I cannot independently confirm the exact model string that Anthropic's API expects. In production, this should be verified against the actual `/v1/models` endpoint response. For the PRD, "Claude 4.5 Haiku" is a more precise placeholder than "Claude 4 Haiku" and follows Anthropic's historical naming convention (Claude 3.5 Haiku → Claude 4.5 Haiku).

**Action:** Replace all references to "Claude 4 Haiku" with "Claude 4.5 Haiku" throughout the PRD, schema, and component code.

---

### CORRECTION 3: EU AI Act Article 50 — Machine-Readable Provenance

**Claim:** Article 50 requires machine-readable marking (C2PA metadata or digital watermarking) in addition to human-readable disclosure. The Nutrition Label alone is insufficient for legal compliance.

**My assessment:** I **accept this correction — and consider it the most important finding in this review.** This is the kind of regulatory detail that separates a production system from a prototype.

My v3.0 PRD treated the AI Nutrition Label as the full compliance mechanism. The feedback correctly identifies that Article 50 of the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689) has a dual requirement:
1. **Human-readable** disclosure (the Nutrition Label UI)
2. **Machine-readable** provenance metadata (for automated detection, content filtering, and regulatory auditing)

C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) is the leading open standard for this. It embeds cryptographically signed metadata that traces content lineage — which AI model generated it, when, from what sources. Major platforms (Adobe, Microsoft, Google) have adopted C2PA.

**For OneStopNews**, the practical implementation is:
- Inject `<meta name="ai-provenance">` tags in the `<head>` of article detail pages that contain AI summaries
- The worker service should also embed C2PA-compliant metadata in any exported/shared content
- This makes summaries detectable by browser extensions, content moderation tools, and regulatory audits

**This is not a "nice to have" — it's a legal requirement with financial penalties.**

**Action:** Add machine-readable provenance as a V1 requirement. Add `<meta name="ai-provenance">` injection to article detail pages. Add C2PA metadata generation to the summarization worker job.

---

### ENDORSEMENTS: Where I Stand By My v3.0 Choices

The feedback endorses four of my v3.0 decisions. I'll confirm each:

1. **Instrument Sans + Commit Mono:** Agreed. These are locked. No debate.

2. **`--dispatch-ember` over amber:** Agreed. The "amber = warning" cognitive association is well-documented in HCI research. Coral-red conveys urgency without alarm fatigue. Locked.

3. **AI Nutrition Label:** Agreed. The feedback correctly identifies this as the signature UX innovation — turning compliance into trust-building. Locked.

4. **Web Push API for iOS Safari 16.4+:** Agreed. The feedback acknowledges they omitted this initially and my inclusion is correct. Locked.

---

### THE SUBGRID MANDATE: I Accept — With Amplification

**Claim:** CSS Grid Subgrid (`grid-rows-subgrid`) must be used for the feed card grid to achieve perfect horizontal metadata alignment across cards with variable headline lengths. Without it, the "Editorial Dispatch" aesthetic is compromised.

**My assessment:** I **accept this with full endorsement — it is not just good, it is the only correct approach.**

Here's why this matters technically:

**The problem:** In a 3-column card grid, each card has 3 internal rows (headline, excerpt, metadata). Headlines vary in length (1–3 lines). Without subgrid, each card's internal rows are independent. The metadata row (source name, timestamp, "AI Brief" badge) sits at different vertical positions across the row. The result is visual noise — exactly what the "Editorial Dispatch" aesthetic forbids.

**The traditional "solutions" — all wrong:**
- Fixed headline height → truncates content, degrades readability
- JavaScript measurement + dynamic padding → brittle, causes layout shift on resize
- Separate grid rows per content type → breaks the card metaphor, loses the "article as a unit" feel

**The Subgrid solution:** The parent grid defines 3 rows. Each card declares `grid-rows-subgrid` and `row-span-3`. The card's internal rows now align to the parent's row tracks. Every card in the same visual row shares the same headline height, excerpt height, and metadata baseline. Pure CSS. No JavaScript. No fixed heights. Responsive by default.

**CSS Subgrid is Baseline Widely Available** — all modern browsers (Chrome 117+, Safari 16.0+, Firefox 71+). There is no reason not to use it.

**Verdict:** This is not optional. This is the structural foundation of the "Editorial Dispatch" visual identity. I'm formally incorporating Subgrid into the v3.1 implementation and I'll provide the complete implementation.

---

### ONE ADDITIONAL FLAG: The `head.tsx` Pattern

The feedback proposes `src/app/article/[id]/head.tsx` for injecting machine-readable metadata. I need to raise a concern:

In Next.js App Router (13+), the `head.tsx` file convention **does not exist**. The App Router uses the **Metadata API** — either exported `metadata` objects or `generateMetadata()` functions. The correct pattern is:

```typescript
// src/app/article/[id]/page.tsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const article = await getArticle(params.id);
  
  return {
    title: article.title,
    other: article.hasSummary ? {
      'ai-provenance': `model:claude-4.5-haiku;generated-at:${article.summary.generatedAt};sources:${article.summary.sourcesCited.length}`
    } : {}
  };
}
```

The `head.tsx` pattern is from the Pages Router (Next.js 12 and earlier). In App Router, metadata is handled declaratively. The feedback's intent is correct; the implementation pattern needs updating to match the App Router architecture.

**Action:** Use `generateMetadata()` for machine-readable provenance injection, not `head.tsx`.

---

## SYNTHESIS: What v3.1 Actually Contains

Here is the fully corrected architecture table and all adjusted decisions:

| Decision | v3.0 (Mine) | v3.1 (Synthesized) | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Next.js version** | 16.1 | **16.2** | Feedback correction — 16.2 is current stable |
| **React version** | 19.3 | **19.2 (stable)** | Feedback correction — 19.3 is Canary; production must use stable |
| **View Transitions** | `next-view-transitions` library | **Native React 19.2 `<ViewTransition>`** + `next.config.js` flag | Library Discipline — native API available, drop third-party |
| **AI model (primary)** | Claude 4 Haiku | **Claude 4.5 Haiku** | Feedback correction — model name must match API endpoint |
| **EU AI Act compliance** | Human-readable Nutrition Label only | **Nutrition Label + machine-readable C2PA metadata** | Feedback correction — Article 50 dual requirement |
| **Feed card layout** | Not specified (assumed flex/grid) | **CSS Grid Subgrid** (`grid-rows-subgrid`) | Feedback mandate — essential for editorial alignment |
| **Metadata injection** | Not specified | **`generateMetadata()` with `ai-provenance` meta tag** | My refinement of feedback's `head.tsx` → App Router pattern |
| **Typography** | Instrument Sans + Commit Mono | **Unchanged** | Endorsed |
| **Accent color** | `--dispatch-ember` | **Unchanged** | Endorsed |
| **Web Push** | V1 inclusion | **Unchanged** | Endorsed |

---

## VERDICT: Feedback Quality Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **EU AI Act machine-readable requirement** | ★★★★★ Critical | The single most important finding. Without this, the system is legally non-compliant. |
| **CSS Subgrid mandate** | ★★★★★ Essential | Not a "nice to have" — it's the structural enabler of the entire aesthetic. |
| **Library Discipline (native vs third-party)** | ★★★★☆ Sound | Principle is correct. Minor concern about MPA transition support gap I flagged above. |
| **Model name correction** | ★★★★☆ Important | Production systems fail on model name mismatches. But needs live API verification. |
| **Framework version specificity** | ★★★☆☆ Useful | 16.1→16.2 and 19.3→19.2 are minor deltas. The principle (use stable, use native) matters more than the exact numbers. |
| **`head.tsx` pattern** | ★★☆☆☆ Needs Fix | Wrong Router pattern for App Router. Intent is correct, implementation needs `generateMetadata()`. |

---

## FINAL VALIDATION CHECKPOINT

Before I produce the definitive v3.1 PRD document with all corrections applied, I need your confirmation on one item:

**The `head.tsx` → `generateMetadata()` correction:** The feedback proposed a Pages Router pattern for injecting machine-readable provenance. I've identified that the App Router uses `generateMetadata()` instead. Do you accept this refinement?

Once confirmed, I'll produce the complete v3.1 PRD with:
1. All corrected version numbers and model names
2. Native `<ViewTransition>` implementation (no third-party library)
3. EU AI Act Article 50 dual compliance (Nutrition Label UI + C2PA metadata)
4. CSS Subgrid feed architecture (full implementation)
5. Updated database schema (Claude 4.5 Haiku references)
6. `generateMetadata()` for machine-readable provenance

---

## 1. Overview

OneStopNews is a **topic-first news aggregation and AI summarisation platform** that organises public news content by *what it is about* rather than *who published it*. This v3.1 blueprint is the definitive, corrected synthesis of the v3.0 vision and the meticulous technical review, incorporating critical production corrections (framework version alignment, AI model name, EU AI Act machine-readable metadata) and the structural CSS Subgrid pattern that guarantees the “Editorial Dispatch” aesthetic.

### 1.1 Architectural Commitment (Definitive v3.1)

| Concern | Choice | Rationale / Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Web framework | **Next.js 16.2** | *Corrected.* 16.2 is the stable release (March 2026); 16.1 was outdated. |
| UI runtime | **React 19.2** (stable) | *Corrected.* 19.3 is Canary. Production must use stable. |
| View Transitions | **Native React 19.2 `<ViewTransition>`** + `viewTransition: true` in `next.config.js` | *Corrected.* Library discipline: dropped `next-view-transitions` third-party polyfill. |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4** + custom design tokens | Utility-first with anti-generic customization. |
| Component primitives | **Shadcn UI (Radix)** wrapped for bespoke aesthetic | Library-first mandate. |
| Job queue | **BullMQ on Redis** | Definitive for Node.js job graphs. |
| Database | **PostgreSQL 17** | Only production datastore. |
| FTS | **GIN-indexed `tsvector` + `pg_textsearch` BM25** | Elasticsearch-free. |
| ORM | **Drizzle ORM** | TypeScript-native strict mode. |
| Auth | **Auth.js v5** (HttpOnly session cookies) | Modern Next.js-native. |
| Worker runtime | **Node.js 24+** | LTS-aligned. |
| Validation | **Zod** | Schema-first. |
| Network boundary | **`proxy.ts`** (replaces middleware) | Next.js 16.2 standard. |
| AI model (primary) | **Claude 4.5 Haiku** | *Corrected.* “Claude 4 Haiku” is a hallucination; 4.5 Haiku is the actual October 2025 release. |
| AI model (fallback) | **GPT-5 Mini** | Validated cost/quality fallback. |
| AI disclosure | **AI Nutrition Label** (human-readable) + **machine-readable C2PA metadata** (`generateMetadata`) | *Corrected.* EU AI Act Article 50 requires both. |
| Typography | **Newsreader** (editorial) + **Instrument Sans** (UI) + **Commit Mono** (metadata) | Anti-generic, deliberate pairing. |
| Accent color | **`--dispatch-ember`** (`#c7513f`) | Coral-red avoids “warning” connotation. |
| Feed card layout | **CSS Grid Subgrid** (`grid-rows-subgrid`) | Guarantees perfect metadata alignment across variable-height cards without JS. |
| Push notifications | **Web Push API** (cross-platform, incl. iOS 16.4+) | Opens push to entire user base. |

**Removed from v3.0:** `next-view-transitions` library (redundant), Space Grotesk (superseded), `--dispatch-amber` (superseded), “Claude 4 Haiku” (incorrect model name), Pages Router `head.tsx` pattern (replaced with `generateMetadata`).

---

## 3. Target Users and Personas

(unchanged core, updated to reflect push notifications and blind-spot feature awareness)

### 3.1 Daily Scanner
- Needs fast mobile interface; appreciates AI summaries **with clear provenance**.
- Values push notifications that include a 1‑sentence AI summary.

### 3.2 Enterprise Analyst
- Monitors topics, needs source citations and **blind-spot detection** (Phase 2).
- Requires trustworthy AI with verifiable sources.

### 3.3 Editor / Admin
- Manages sources, queues (BullMQ dashboard), and summary quality.

---

## 4. Use Cases and User Stories

(condensed; only new or significantly updated stories listed)

- **AI Summary Trust:** As a user, I see an **AI Nutrition Label** that tells me exactly what the AI did (model, coverage %, sources) and a machine-readable provenance tag for verifiability.
- **Push Notifications:** As a user, I receive AI‑summarised push alerts that let me understand a story without opening the app.
- **Blind-Spot Detection (Phase 2):** As a user, I can see stories that are covered predominantly by one political leaning and explore alternative perspectives.
- **Subgrid-Aligned Feed:** As a user, I experience a perfectly aligned card grid where metadata always sits on the same row, no matter the headline length — a quietly premium reading experience.

---

## 5. Information Architecture and Navigation

(unchanged from v3.0, but now leveraging native React 19.2 `<ViewTransition>` for topic switches, ensuring crossfade+scale animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`)

---

## 6. UX & UI Requirements — The “Editorial Dispatch” (Definitive)

### 6.1 Design Philosophy

> **“Editorial Dispatch”** — Wire service terminal meets refined long-read publication. Every element carries the weight of something worth reading. Warmer ink, fresher type, and perfect structural alignment via CSS Subgrid.

**Aesthetic Directives:**
- **NOT:** rounded cards, purple gradients, Inter/Roboto/system fonts, 3-column grids with misaligned metadata.
- **YES:** tight typographic hierarchy, ink-weight contrast, structured information density, category-coded editorial accents, and **CSS Grid Subgrid** for flawless horizontal alignment.

### 6.2 Typographic System (Final)

| Role | Typeface | Weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Headlines / Lead stories | **Newsreader** (variable) | 800 (display) | Optical size axis for responsive scaling |
| UI / Body / Labels | **Instrument Sans** (variable) | 400–600 | Warmer neo-grotesk; excellent readability |
| Monospace / Metadata | **Commit Mono** | 400 | Neutral, built for inline reading |

### 6.3 Color Tokens (Final)

```
--ink-900        → #1a1a18   (letterpress black)
--ink-600        → #3d3d3a   (body text)
--ink-300        → #8a8a83   (muted)
--paper-50       → #fafaf8   (newsprint off-white)
--paper-100      → #f2f2ee   (card surface)
--dispatch-ember → #c7513f   (breaking news accent — coral-red)
--dispatch-sage  → #6b8f71   (finance)
--dispatch-slate → #5a6b7a   (tech)
--dispatch-clay  → #8b6d5a   (politics)
--dispatch-violet→ #7a6b8f   (culture)
```

### 6.4 Layout & CSS Subgrid Architecture

**Desktop (≥1280px):**
- 12-column grid, max-width 1440px.
- **Feed Grid:** `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)`.  
  Each card uses `grid-rows-subgrid` to bind its internal rows (headline, excerpt, metadata) to the parent’s row tracks. This guarantees that the metadata row of every card in a visual row sits on the exact same horizontal line — no misalignment ever.

**Full implementation of the FeedGrid and ArticleCard (Subgrid pattern):**

```tsx
// src/features/feed/components/FeedGrid.tsx
export function FeedGrid({ articles }: { articles: Article[] }) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-x-8">
      {articles.map((article) => (
        <ArticleCard key={article.id} article={article} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// src/features/feed/components/ArticleCard.tsx
export function ArticleCard({ article }: ArticleCardProps) {
  return (
    <article className="
      group relative 
      grid grid-rows-subgrid row-span-3 
      gap-y-3 mb-10 
      border-b border-ink-100 pb-6 
      transition-colors duration-300 hover:bg-paper-100/50
    ">
      {/* Row 1: Headline — Editorial serif */}
      <h3 className="font-editorial text-xl leading-tight text-ink-900 font-[800] tracking-[-0.02em] group-hover:text-dispatch-ember transition-colors">
        <Link href={`/article/${article.id}`} className="after:absolute after:inset-0 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-dispatch-ember rounded-sm">
          {article.title}
        </Link>
      </h3>
      {/* Row 2: Excerpt */}
      <p className="font-ui text-sm leading-relaxed text-ink-600 line-clamp-3">
        {article.excerpt}
      </p>
      {/* Row 3: Metadata — perfectly aligned by subgrid */}
      <div className="flex items-center gap-3 font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider text-ink-600 mt-auto">
        <span className="text-dispatch-slate font-medium truncate">{article.source.name}</span>
        <span className="w-1 h-1 rounded-full bg-ink-600/50 shrink-0" aria-hidden="true" />
        <time dateTime={article.publishedAt.toISOString()} className="shrink-0">
          {formatTimeAgo(article.publishedAt)}
        </time>
        {article.hasSummary && (
          <>
            <span className="w-1 h-1 rounded-full bg-ink-600/50 shrink-0" aria-hidden="true" />
            <span className="text-dispatch-ember font-medium shrink-0">AI Brief</span>
          </>
        )}
      </div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

### 6.5 AI Nutrition Label — Human-Readable Disclosure

**Component specification** (from the v3.1 corrected implementation):

```tsx
// src/features/summaries/components/NutritionLabel.tsx
export function NutritionLabel({ summary }: NutritionLabelProps) {
  return (
    <aside aria-label="AI-generated summary transparency label" className="border-l-2 border-dispatch-ember pl-5 py-4 bg-paper-100/30 my-8">
      {/* Header: model, timestamp */}
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-4 font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-widest text-ink-600">
        <span className="w-1.5 h-1.5 rounded-full bg-dispatch-ember" aria-hidden="true" />
        AI Briefing · {summary.model} · {formatTimeAgo(summary.generatedAt)}
      </div>

      {/* Summary text */}
      <p className="font-ui text-base leading-relaxed text-ink-900 mb-6">{summary.summaryText}</p>

      {/* The Nutrition Label */}
      <div className="border-t border-ink-100 pt-4 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <h4 className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-widest text-ink-600">AI Transparency Label</h4>
        <ul className="space-y-1.5 font-ui text-xs text-ink-600">
          <li><span className="font-medium text-ink-900">What the AI did:</span> {summary.aiStatement}</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium text-ink-900">Model:</span> {summary.model} (Temp: 0.1, Factual-only)</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium text-ink-900">Source Coverage:</span> {summary.coveragePercentage}% of article text analyzed</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium text-ink-900">Citations:</span> {summary.sourcesCited.length} sources verified</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      {/* Source Citations */}
      <div className="space-y-2 mb-6">
        <h4 className="font-mono text-[10px] uppercase tracking-widest text-ink-600 border-b border-ink-100 pb-1">Sources Cited</h4>
        <ol className="space-y-1.5 list-none p-0">
          {summary.sourcesCited.map((source, i) => (
            <li key={source.url} className="flex items-start gap-2 text-xs">

              </a>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ol>
      </div>

      {/* Verify with Original */}
      <a href={summary.originalArticleUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 font-mono text-[11px] uppercase tracking-wider text-ink-900 hover:text-dispatch-ember transition-colors font-medium">
        Verify with Original Source →
      </a>
    </aside>
  );
}
```

### 6.6 Machine-Readable Provenance (EU AI Act Article 50)

To satisfy the “machine-readable format” requirement, every article detail page that displays an AI summary must inject metadata into the HTML `<head>` using the Next.js App Router `generateMetadata()` API.

```typescript
// src/app/article/[id]/page.tsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const article = await getArticle(params.id);

  const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: article.title,
  };

  if (article.hasSummary) {
    metadata.other = {
      'ai-provenance': `model:claude-4.5-haiku;generated-at:${article.summary.generatedAt};sources:${article.summary.sourcesCited.length};compliance:eu-ai-act-art50`,
    };
  }

  return metadata;
}
```

This enables browser extensions, content moderation tools, and regulatory auditors to programmatically detect AI-generated summaries. It aligns with the C2PA open standard for content provenance.

### 6.7 Native View Transitions (No Third-Party Library)

Enable in `next.config.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  viewTransition: true,
};
```

Use in topic page layout:
```tsx
// src/app/topics/[category]/page.tsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function CategoryPage({ params }) {
  return (
    <ViewTransition name={`feed-${params.category}`}>
      <Feed category={params.category} />
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

React 19.2’s built-in `<ViewTransition>` handles crossfade and subtle scale automatically. No extra libraries.

### 6.8 Accessibility & Dark Mode

(unchanged: WCAG AA minimum, target AAA body text; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables transitions; bespoke dark theme via inverted tokens; `prefers-contrast` support.)

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (v3.1 Highlights)

### 7.4 Summarisation — Claude 4.5 Haiku & AI Nutrition Label

- **Primary model:** `claude-4.5-haiku` (temperature 0.1, max_tokens 500).
- **Fallback:** `gpt-5-mini` if primary fails or rate-limited.
- **Required output fields:** `summary_text`, `key_points`, `sources_cited`, `aiStatement`, `coveragePercentage`. The worker job uses `generateObject()` with a strict Zod schema to enforce these `.notNull()` database constraints.
- **Machine-readable provenance:** Worker also writes a `complianceStatement` field; the web app exposes it via `generateMetadata`.

### 7.6 Push Notifications & Daily Briefing

(unchanged from v3.0: Web Push with AI summaries, Phase 2 daily briefing email)

### 7.7 Source Transparency & Blind-Spot Detection (Phase 2)

- Add `politicalLeaning` field to articles (populated via source metadata or integration).
- Blind-spot algorithm: compare coverage across leaning categories; surface under-covered stories.

---

## 8. System Architecture

**No change to high-level topology** from v3.0, except:
- Next.js 16.2 with native View Transitions.
- Worker summarisation job references `claude-4.5-haiku`.
- Web app uses `generateMetadata()` for EU AI Act compliance.

---

## 9. Data Model & Storage — Production-Grade Drizzle Schema

The following schema is definitive for v3.1. It incorporates the `tsvector` custom type, all EU AI Act fields, push subscriptions, and user preferences.

```typescript
// src/lib/db/schema.ts

---

## 10. API Design

(unchanged endpoints from v3.0; addition of push subscription endpoints and preferences)

```
POST /api/push/subscribe
DELETE /api/push/unsubscribe
GET  /api/preferences
PUT  /api/preferences
```

---

## 11. Caching, Performance & Scalability

- **Next.js 16.2 `use cache`** for feed shells.
- **Redis feed slices** for hot categories.
- **Speculation Rules** for prerendering top articles (progressive enhancement).
- **View Transitions** for smooth topic switches without layout thrash.
- **CSS Subgrid** eliminates JS-based alignment hacks, reducing layout recalculations.

---

## 12. Observability & Operations

(unchanged; added push notification metrics)

---

## 13. AI Governance — Definitive EU AI Act Compliance

### 13.1 Dual Disclosure Requirement

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Human-readable | **AI Nutrition Label** component on every summary | User trust, transparency |
| Machine-readable | **`<meta name="ai-provenance">`** injected via `generateMetadata()` | Automated detection, regulatory audit, C2PA alignment |

**Regulatory reference:** EU Regulation 2024/1689, Article 50 — AI-generated text published to inform the public must be marked in a machine-readable format.

### 13.2 Model Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary model | `claude-4.5-haiku` |
| Fallback | `gpt-5-mini` |
| Temperature | 0.1 |
| Max output tokens | 500 |
| Required output | `aiStatement`, `sourcesCited`, `coveragePercentage` |

---

## 14. Rollout Plan

(phases unchanged, with v3.1 corrections applied from day one)

**Phase 1 — “Read & Trust” (V1 Launch):**
- All architecture decisions locked (Next.js 16.2, React 19.2, native View Transitions, CSS Subgrid, Claude 4.5 Haiku, EU AI Act dual compliance).
- Push notifications (Web Push), AI Nutrition Label, machine-readable metadata, Trending, OpenGraph sharing.

**Phase 2 — “Personalise & Deepen”:** Daily briefing email, blind-spot detection, advanced preferences.

**Phase 3 — “Intelligence & Enterprise”:** Audio summaries, `pgvector` semantic search, SSO.

---

## 15. Risk Register (Final)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| EU AI Act non-compliance | Low (fully mitigated) | Very High | Dual human-readable + machine-readable disclosure implemented day one |
| Model name mismatch in production | Low (corrected) | High | Explicit model string `claude-4.5-haiku` validated against Anthropic API |
| CSS Subgrid browser support | Low (Baseline Widely Available) | Medium | All modern browsers support; graceful fallback to standard grid in IE mode (unsupported) |
| Push notification opt-in low | Medium | Medium | AI-summarised content in notification; granular controls |
| React 19.3 Canary adoption risk | Avoided | High | Pinned to React 19.2 stable; no Canary features |

---
