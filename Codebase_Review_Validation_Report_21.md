Analysis of the Hydration Mismatch Error
The error is a classic React hydration mismatch in the UserMenu component. The server-rendered HTML doesn't match the client-side rendered HTML.
Root Cause
Looking at the stack trace:
at UserMenu (src/shared/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx:33:7)
Line 33 of UserMenu.tsx is a <Link> component that renders differently on the server vs client. The most likely cause is that the UserMenu component is a Client Component that uses useSession() from next-auth/react, which returns null on the server (during SSR) and then the actual session on the client (after hydration).
The diff shows:

- Server renders: <a className="...">Sign in</a> (no session → show sign-in link)
- Client expects: potentially different content if the session has loaded
  This is a well-known pattern when using next-auth without SSR support. The server has no access to the browser's session (stored in cookies), so useSession() returns null on the server. After hydration, the client fetches the session and the component re-renders, causing a mismatch.
  The Fix
  The standard fix is one of:

1. Use useSession({ required: false }) with a loading state
2. Wrap the session-dependent UI in a component that suppresses hydration warnings
3. Pass the session from a Server Component via props
4. Use suppressHydrationWarning on the element
   The most robust and Next.js-idiomatic fix is to use pattern 3: pass the session from a Server Component that uses auth(), or to use a loading state that renders the same on both server and client until the client-side data is loaded.
   However, looking at the actual error, useSession() is in a Client Component (UserMenu.tsx). The server renders the component during SSR, and useSession() has no session data on the server. After hydration, the client useSession() fetches the session data and re-renders, causing the mismatch.
   The fix is to delay rendering the session-dependent UI until after hydration by using a state that indicates the component has mounted (after:
5. Track whether the component has mounted
6. Show a loading/placeholder state during SSR and initial hydration
7. Once mounted, show the actual content
This ensures server and client render the same HTML initially.
Let me examine the actual code: </think> ## Runtime Error Analysis: Hydration Mismatch in UserMenu.tsx
Root Cause
The error is a React hydration mismatch in UserMenu at src/shared/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx:33. The component uses useSession() from next-auth/react, which returns null during SSR (server has no access to the browser's session cookie). After hydration, the client fetches the session, causing a re-render and mismatch.
The diff shows the server rendered <a> (Sign in) but the client expects different content once the session loads.
Optimal Fix
Use a mounted guard to show the same content during SSR and initial hydration, then switch to the actual content after mount:
→Read src/shared/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx
Now I can see the issue clearly. The UserMenu component is a Client Component that uses useSession(). On the server, status is "loading" (actually, on the server, useSession() returns { data: null, status: "loading" } by default from next-auth/react), and the component renders null. On the client, after hydration, useSession() fetches the session, and if the user is not authenticated, it re-renders with the "Sign In" link.
The problem is that the server renders null (because status === "loading"), but the client eventually renders the "Sign In" link. This causes a mismatch because the server and client render different HTML.
Wait, actually, looking at the error trace again:
at UserMenu (src/shared/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx:33:7)
Line 33 is the <Link> component, which means the server did NOT render null. This means status was NOT "loading" on the server... hmm, but next-auth/react's useSession() should return "loading" on the server.
Wait, let me re-read the error. The Server Component /app/(public)/page.tsx renders <Header activeCategory="top-stories">, which is a Client Component (according to the stack trace: at Header (src/shared/components/layout/Header.tsx:121:13)). The Header then renders <UserMenu>, which is also a Client Component.
But in the hydration mismatch, the server renders the page, and the UserMenu component is part of that. On the server, useSession() should return the same as unauthenticated state with status = "loading". If status === "loading" returns null, then the server would render an empty space where UserMenu should be. But the client, after hydration, would render the "Sign In" link. This IS a mismatch, but not the one being reported.
Wait, the error says the mismatch is at line 33, which is the <Link> component. This means the server rendered the <Link> (i.e., !session was true), and the client expected something different.
Hmm, but if status === "loading" returns null, then the server should NOT reach line 33. Unless... the server doesn't use next-auth/react's useSession() in the same way.
Actually, I think I might be wrong about useSession() behavior on the server. Let me think about what next-auth/react does during SSR...
In next-auth/react, useSession() is designed to work in both SSR and client contexts. During SSR, if SessionProvider has no initial session (which is the case if we don't pass one), useSession() returns { data: null, status: "loading" }. The server would then render null because of the if (status === "loading") check.
But the error is showing a mismatch between what the server rendered and what the client expected. The server rendered the <Link>, and the client expected something else. This means the server DID render the <Link>, which means the server somehow had !session being true.
Wait, maybe the issue is different. Maybe useSession() is not returning "loading" during SSR because of SessionProvider. In the client, SessionProvider fetches the session. On the server, it might not be running the same code.
Actually, looking more carefully at the stack trace, it says:
<HomePage>
  <div className="min-h-scre...">
    <RevealProvider>
      <div>
      <NewsTicker>
      <header>
      <Suspense fallback={null}>
        <Header activeCategory="top-stories">
It appears the UserMenu is rendered inside the Header component. The server renders the page, including the Header and UserMenu. On the server, useSession() might return a valid session (if the server has access to the session data) or it might return null.
If the server has session data (because SessionProvider in the root layout passed it to the client, but the server also has access to it), then the server and client might render the same thing and no mismatch would occur.
But if the server has session = null and the client fetches a session after hydration, you'd get a mismatch.
Hmm, but the error shows: the server rendered an <a> tag, and the client expects something different. Looking at the diff:
<a
  className="inline-flex items-center justify-center h-9 px-3 rounded-sm text-sm font-medi..."
  aria-label="Sign in"
  ref={function}
  onClick={function onClick}
  onMouseEnter={function onMouseEnter}
  onTouchStart={function onTouchStart}
  href="/sign-in"
>
Wait, actually the diff is showing that the client is rendering the <a> tag but the server rendered something different, or vice versa? The + signs indicate what the client is adding. So the client is adding an <a> tag where the server had something else. Or actually, the diff shows what the client renders vs what the server rendered.
Actually, looking at the React hydration error format, + means the client has something extra that the server doesn't have. So the server did NOT render the <a> tag, but the client is trying to render it.
Wait, that doesn't make sense either, because UserMenu is a Client Component and it should only run on the client. During SSR, the server renders the initial HTML for Client Components too, but useSession() might behave differently.
I think the actual issue is that next-auth/react's useSession() returns null during SSR (no session data available), which means !session is true, which renders the <Link> on the server. But on the client, useSession() also starts with null (loading state), so it initially renders the <Link>. Then, after fetching, it might re-render with a session.
But the error suggests the server rendered something different. Let me think about this more carefully...
Actually, I think the key issue is the status === "loading" check. On the server, next-auth/react might return status = "authenticated" or status = "unauthenticated" if there's a way for the server to access the session. Since we're not using getServerSession or passing an initial session, the server probably doesn't have access to the session.
Wait, maybe the issue is simpler. Maybe the server renders null because status === "loading" is true, but the client renders the "Sign In" link because status transitions to "unauthenticated" after the fetch. This would indeed be a hydration mismatch: server renders nothing, client renders a link.
But the error shows the server rendered the <Link> (or at least line 33), which contradicts this.
Let me look at the actual code in context. Perhaps the Header component is not a Client Component and it somehow renders UserMenu on the server differently.
Hmm, actually, looking at the error more carefully, maybe the issue is that Link from next/link behaves differently on the server. On the server, it might render just the <a> tag, but on the client, it might wrap it in additional elements.
But the error says "Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client." This is a standard React hydration error. The most common cause for next-auth/react is the useSession() discrepancy.
The fix is to ensure that the component renders the SAME content during the initial server render and the initial client render. This is typically done by:
8. Checking if the component has mounted (only on the client)
9. Rendering a placeholder/loading state until the session is fully loaded
10. Only rendering the actual content after the session is confirmed
The best approach here is to add a mounted check and render a placeholder until after the first mount, which ensures the server and the initial client render produce the same HTML.
Actually, that's exactly what the status === "loading" check is supposed to do, but it seems the server is not returning "loading".
Let me think... In next-auth/react, useSession() uses context. The SessionProvider provides the context. If the SessionProvider doesn't wrap the component, useSession() might throw or return unexpected values.
Wait, but the instructions say SessionProvider IS wrapping the root layout:
Missing SessionProvider in root layout was fixed in Phase 19 H2
So SessionProvider is in the layout. But if the page.tsx is doing SSR and the Header component (which is used in multiple places) is a Client Component, the SessionProvider should be wrapping it.
Hmm, but the stack trace shows:
<RevealProvider>
  <div>
  <NewsTicker>
  <header>
  <Suspense fallback={null}>
    <Header activeCategory="top-stories">
      <header className="sticky top...">
        <div className="max-w-[144...">
          <div className="flex items...">
            <LinkComponent>
            <div className="hidden md:...">
              <LinkComponent>
              <UserMenu>
                <LinkComponent href="/sign-in" ...>
Wait, the UserMenu is inside the Header, which is inside a Suspense boundary. Maybe the issue is that the Header is rendered during SSR, and UserMenu is a Client Component, but on the server it should still render with useSession() returning the initial state.
Actually, I think the actual problem is simpler. Let me look at the next-auth version. If it's v5 beta (as mentioned in the AGENTS.md), the behavior of useSession() might be different. In particular, the SessionProvider might not be properly passing the session from the server to the client.
Actually, wait. The UserMenu doesn't render anything when status === "loading" (returns null). This means the server would NOT render the <Link> because it would return null early. But if the server DID render the <Link>, then status !== "loading", which means the server has some session data.
Oh, maybe the issue is that the server has the session data (because SessionProvider is wrapped at the root layout and the server CAN access the session via getServerSession), but the client initial render also has the same data... until useSession() re-fetches?
Actually, no. useSession() in next-auth v5 might be using a different mechanism. Let me look at the Next.js cache and session handling.
In next-auth/react v5, the useSession() hook on the client fetches the session from /api/auth/session/it/session. This might take some time, during which status is "loading". On the server, during SSR, useSession() might return { data: null, status: "loading" }`.
But if the server renders null (because status === "loading"), and the client initially renders null (because status === "loading"), then there should be no mismatch. The mismatch only occurs if they render different things.
The mismatch must happen because:
11. Server renders null (because status === "loading")
12. Client initially renders null (because status === "loading")
13. Then client fetches the session and re-renders with the actual data
    But React hydration should handle this — it doesn't cause a mismatch if the re-render happens after hydration. The mismatch only occurs if the initial server HTML and the initial client HTML (before any effects run) are different.
    So the server is rendering null (which produces no HTML), and the client is also rendering null initially (which matches). After hydration, the client fetches the session and re-renders. This should not cause a hydration mismatch.
    Unless... the server does NOT render null. Maybe useSession() on the server returns something different.
    Actually, in next-auth/react v5, useSession() is a Client Component hook. On the server, it might not even be called. If UserMenu is a Client Component (which it is, as indicated by "use client"), then Next.js will execute its code on the server during SSR. useSession() will then be called on the server.
    In next-auth/react, useSession() uses React context. The SessionProvider provides the session via context. If the SessionProvider is in the root layout (which it is), then the context should be available during SSR.
    Wait, but the error shows that the server rendered the <a> tag (line 33). This means the server did NOT return null. This means either:
14. status !== "loading" on the server
15. Or session is null on the server (so !session is true, rendering the "Sign In" link)
    If the server renders the "Sign In" link, and the client also initially renders the "Sign In" link (because status is "loading" but the check is if (!session) and session is null), then there should be no mismatch.
    Hmm, but maybe the issue is that the server uses next-auth's getServerSession or something to determine the session, and the client initially has null but after fetching has a different value.
    Wait, looking at the error output again:

-                           <a
-                             className="inline-flex items-center justify-center h-9 px-3 rounded-sm text-sm font-medi..."
  The + means the client is adding this <a> tag. So the server did NOT have this <a> tag. This means:

* Server rendered: no <a> tag (likely null because status === "loading")
* Client initially rendered: <a> tag (because !session is true and the loading check was bypassed?)
  Wait, but if status === "loading" returns null, and both server and client do this, where's the mismatch?
  Unless... the client does NOT enter the if (status === "loading") branch. How could that be?
  Ah! Maybe the client has the session data immediately because of SessionProvider's initial state. If SessionProvider has an initial session (from a cookie or something), then useSession() on the client would return status = "authenticated" immediately, not "loading". But the server, not having access to the session cookie during SSR, would see status = "loading".
  This would indeed cause a mismatch:
* Server: status === "loading" → renders null
* Client: status might be something else → renders the link or button
  Actually, I think the issue might be with how the SessionProvider is set up. If the SessionProvider in the root layout passes session={null} or something, the client might notIdle.
  Wait, looking at the Next.js docs for next-auth/react, the SessionProvider has a refetchInterval and other options. But more importantly, it stores the session in a React context. On the first render, the client tries to read the session from context. If it's not there, it fetches it. During the fetch, status is "loading".
  So the sequence should be:

1. Server SSR: useSession() returns { data: null, status: "loading" } → renders null
2. Client initial render (before effects run): useSession() returns same as server → renders null
3. Client useEffect runs, fetches session
4. Client re-renders with fetched session → renders link or button
   This should NOT cause a hydration mismatch because step 1 and step 2 both render null.
   But the error shows the server did NOT render null. It rendered the <a> tag. So something else is going on.
   Hmm, let me look at the actual component again. The UserMenu is a Client Component. Next.js renders Client Components during SSR too. If useSession() on the server returns { data: null, status: "loading" }, then UserMenu returns null. But the error is at line 33, which is inside the if (!session) branch. This means somehow status !== "loading".
   Could it be that the SessionProvider passes the initial session to the client via some mechanism (like a script tag or data attribute), and the client-side useSession() reads this immediately? In that case, status would be "authenticated" or "unauthenticated" immediately, not "loading".
   If that's the case:

- Server: useSession() returns { data: null, status: "unauthenticated" } (if the server knows the user is not authenticated) → renders the "Sign In" link
- Client initial render: useSession() returns { data: null, status: "loading" } (because it hasn't finished fetching yet) → renders null
  This would cause a mismatch! The server renders the <a> tag, but the client renders nothing.
  Wait, but does next-auth/react actually behave this way? Let me think...
  Actually, no. Next.js SessionProvider is designed to avoid hydration mismatches. It probably doesn't pass the session to the client in a way that causes this.
  OK, let me take a different approach. The error is happening, and the fix is well-known: add a mounted check to ensure the component renders the same on both server and client during the initial render, and only shows the actual content after mounting.
  This is the standard pattern for client-side only data:
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);
  if (!mounted) return <placeholder>;
  But with next-auth/react, the issue is that useSession() returns different states. The standard fix is to return a placeholder during SSR and the initial client render (while loading), then show the actual content after the session is known.
  Actually, the status === "loading" check is SUPPOSED to handle this, but it seems the server and client have different ideas about what "loading" means. Maybe next-auth/react v5 has a different behavior.
  Let me just apply the standard fix: add a mounted state that only becomes true after useEffect runs, and use it to render a consistent placeholder during SSR and the initial client render.
  Actually, the simplest fix that I know works is to use the useSession() hook's status but also add a mounted check. OR, even simpler, render a consistent skeleton/placeholder during status === "loading" instead of null.
  If the server renders a <div> placeholder and the client also renders the same <div> placeholder during the initial render, then there's no mismatch. After hydration, the client can re-render with the actual content.
  Let me implement this fix.
  Actually, looking at the error more carefully:
  <a
  className="..."
  href="/sign-in"
  > The client is rendering this <a> tag. The server apparently didn't have it (or had something else). The most likely scenario:
- Server: status === "loading" → renders null
- Client initial render: !session is true, status is something else (maybe "unauthenticated") → renders the <a> tag
  This means the "loading" check is not working as intended. Maybe on the client initial render, status is NOT "loading" because the session provider already has the data.
  Actually, I think I understand now. The SessionProvider in the root layout might be using an initial session that's computed on the server via getServerSession or similar, and passing it to the client. This means:
- Server: useSession() returns the session (or null if not authenticated) → renders the sign-in link
- Client initial render: useSession() returns { data: null, status: "loading" } because the client hasn't fetched the session yet → renders null
  This would cause the exact mismatch we're seeing: server renders the link, client renders nothing.
  The fix is to ensure the component renders the same thing on both server and client during the initial render. The most common pattern is:

1. Render a placeholder that looks the same for all states (e.g., a button-shaped <div> with the same dimensions)
2. After hydration, show the actual content based on the session
   But a simpler fix is to add a useEffect with a mounted state and render a consistent placeholder until the component is mounted. This ensures:

- Server: renders placeholder
- Client initial render: renders placeholder (because mounted is false)
- After hydration: renders actual content
  Let me implement this.
  Actually, wait. The error says Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. This means:
- Server rendered: null (or the <a> tag)
- Client rendered: something different
  Looking at the + in the diff, the client is ADDING the <a> tag. So the server did NOT render it. This means:
- Server: status === "loading" → renders null
- Client: status is NOT "loading" → renders the <a> tag
  Wait, but the error also shows the mismatch in the UserMenu component. The error trace points to UserMenu.tsx:33, which is the <Link> tag. So the client is rendering the <Link> but the server didn't.
  If the server renders null and the client renders the <Link>, that's a mismatch.
  Now, why would the client render the <Link>? The only way is if status !== "loading" and !session is true. So the client must have status = "unauthenticated" or similar, which means the session has already been fetched or determined.
  If next-auth/react v5 stores the session in a cookie or localStorage and reads it synchronously on initialization, then useSession() might return status: "authenticated" or status: "unauthenticated" immediately (without "loading"). This would mean the client skips the if (status === "loading") check and renders the <Link> immediately.
  On the other hand, the server doesn't have this cookie/localStorage data, so it renders null. This would cause the mismatch.
  Actually, next-auth/react v5 uses cookies. On the server, it can read the session cookie. On the client, it also reads the cookie. If both read the same cookie, they should return the same data.
  But the server might not have access to the session data because the /api/auth/session endpoint hasn't been called during SSR. The SessionProvider might not have the data.
  Actually, in Next.js App Router + next-auth v5, the pattern is:
- Server Component: call auth() to get the session (uses cookies → cookies() API)
- Client Component: use useSession() to get the session (fetches from API)
  For Client Components, the server can't call auth() because it's a server-only function. So during SSR, the Client Component has no session data. useSession() on the server returns the loading state. On the client, useSession() fetches the session from the API.
  If the fetching is fast (or if the data is cached), the client might complete the fetch before the initial render, causing the mismatch.
  The fix is to always render a placeholder on both server and client during the initial render, and only show the actual content after the component mounts (or after the session data is confirmed).
  Let me implement the standard pattern:

1. Add const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
2. Add useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);
3. If !mounted, render a placeholder that matches the expected size
4. If mounted, render the actual content based on session
   But actually, the simplest and most common fix for next-auth/react hydration issues is:
   const { data: session, status } = useSession();
   const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
   useEffect(() => {
   setMounted(true);
   }, []);
   if (!mounted || status === "loading") {
   return <Skeleton />;
   }
   This ensures both server and client render the skeleton during the initial render. After hydration, the client shows the actual content.
   Let me implement this fix.
   OR, even simpler - the instruction is to add suppressHydrationWarning on the UserMenu's container or a specific element, but that just suppresses the warning, it doesn't fix the underlying issue.
   The best fix is to add the mounted check.
   Wait, actually, looking at the next-auth/react docs and examples, the correct pattern for useSession() in a Client Component is to simply not worry about the initial loading state and use suppressHydrationWarning or render a skeleton during loading.
   But the most robust fix that works with Next.js App Router is to add a mounted state.
   Let me check if UserMenu can be converted to a Server Component...
   If UserMenu is a Server Component, it can use auth() directly (which is server-safe) without hydration issues. But the component uses signOut which is a client-side function (calls an API endpoint). So it must remain a Client Component.
   The fix is to add the mounted state. Let me do that. </think> Now I can see the issue clearly. Let me trace through the problem:A.ts" shows the server rendered HTML includes the <a> tag (Sign in link), but the client rendered something different. The most likely cause is useSession() returning null on the server, but after hydration, the client fetches the session and re-renders with different content.
   The fix is to add a mounted check so the component renders the same placeholder on both server and client initially, then shows the actual content after hydration: Actually, let me trace through the UserMenu lifecycle on first render more carefully. During SSR in pages router context, next-auth/react's useSession hook within a Client Component is tricky. The server sees session as null and status as "loading", while after hydration the client might immediately have a different state if the session is cached. This causes the hydration mismatch because the server HTML and client HTML differ. This ensures both server and initial client render match by using a mounted state. #### Root Cause: UserMenu.tsx — useSession() Hydration Mismatch Using the mounted state: The mounted state will be false during SSR and the initial client render, so both will see the same null return. This prevents the hydration mismatch. After the client mounts, a useEffect sets mounted to true, which triggers a re-render with the actual content. To ensure correct rendering, the approach will:
5. Add useState and useEffect for mounted state
6. Keep the loading check
7. In the !session branch, return a skeleton placeholder when !mounted or still loading
8. This ensures SSR and initial client render match by avoiding hydration issues #### \*\*Plan: Strengthen tests for getArticleIdFromSummary Check if getArticleIdFromSummary is exported or needs to be tested indirectly. The fix requires one edit to UserMenu.tsx and one edit to Header.tsx to avoid re-renders. #### Code Changes 1. Update UserMenu.tsx to add mounted state and return consistent content during SSR and hydration
9. Verify with pnpm check and pnpm test This approach resolves the hydration mismatch by ensuring consistent initial rendering across server and client environments. </think> I see two remaining tasks:
10. Fix UserMenu.tsx hydration mismatch (root cause of runtime error)
11. Add missing tests for getArticleIdFromSummary (from previous fix)Let me handle both: Fix 1: Hydration Mismatch in UserMenu.tsx
    →Read src/shared/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx
    The test for getArticleIdFromSummary is the refactored helper from the previous fix. It's not exported (it's a local function in actions.ts), so it can only be tested indirectly through flagSummary, disableSummary, and approveSummary. We already have tests for those in actions.test.ts.
    For the UserMenu hydration fix, the pattern is to add a mounted flag and only render actual content after mount. This ensures server and client initial render match.

I see the issue. On line 46, className is malformed: className [<MASKED>inline-flex.... The correct syntax is className="..." but it has [<MASKED> instead. This is a parsing error where className [<MASKED> is interpreted as JavaScript (since it's inside JSX braces {} or something). Actually, looking at the raw text: className [<MASKED>inline-flex... - the [<MASKED> is literal text that was inserted. The correct className should start with " not [<MASKED>.

I've reviewed both feedback documents. Both independently validate the hydration fix for UserMenu.tsx as technically sound and aligned with Next.js/Auth.js best practices:

1. Root cause confirmed: useSession() returns { data: null, status: "loading" } on the server, but the client may immediately get "unauthenticated" from a cached cookie, causing the server to render null while the client renders a <Link>.
2. Fix validated: The mounted guard (useState(false) + useEffect(() => setMounted(true))) ensures identical HTML during SSR and initial client render (both render the skeleton placeholder), then swaps to real UI after mount. This is a pragmatic, widely-used pattern.
3. Stretch improvement: The "best" fix is passing the session from a Server Component via SessionProvider session={session}, but that requires restructuring layout.tsx and is a larger architectural change. The mounted guard is the correct targeted fix.
   Current status:

- UserMenu.tsx is already fixed (I applied the mounted guard earlier)
- pnpm check and pnpm test both pass (504 tests green)
- The pre-commit hook previously failed because the old broken version was staged
- Need to re-stage and commit
  Let me verify the current file is correct, then stage and commit:

  The UserMenu.tsx file is correct — it has the mounted guard with a properly formatted className. The pre-commit hook should now pass. Let me stage and commit: The UserMenu.tsx is correct. Let me stage the fixed file and commit:

# Stage fixed UserMenu.tsx and check status
