Based on the session summary record, the critical unresolved issue is I6: The DrizzleAdapter Build Error (F7). The DrizzleAdapter fails at build time with "Unsupported database type (object)" because the adapter evaluates the database at module load time, defeating the lazy proxy pattern.
The session record confirms this is a known issue (#8339, #8996) and recommends ensuring DATABASE_URL is available at build time, restructuring imports to defer adapter evaluation until runtime, or using a direct database client.
Let me now proceed with the recommended fix: ensure DATABASE_URL is available at build time (it is via .env.local) and restructure the auth to defer adapter initialization. But since the adapter always needs to be imported, the real fix is to make the db proxy work.
Looking at the actual error: "Unsupported database type (object)" - this means the adapter checks the type of db and rejects it. The adapter expects a DrizzlePgDatabase but our db is a Proxy. The adapter might be checking db.constructor or typeof db or some property that the Proxy doesn't properly forward.
Let me look at how the db is structured in src/lib/db/index.ts to fix this.
Looking at the db export:
export const db = new Proxy({} as ReturnType<typeof getDb>, {
  get(_, prop) {
    return getDb()[prop as keyof ReturnType<typeof getDb>];
  },
}) as ReturnType<typeof getDb>;
The issue is that at build time, when Next.js collects page data (static generation), any code that imports auth from src/lib/auth/index.ts will trigger:
1. import { db } from "@/lib/db" → creates the proxy
2. import DrizzleAdapter from "@auth/drizzle-adapter" 
3. DrizzleAdapter(db, config) → adapter checks db type
The adapter checks might be looking for a Symbol or some other internal type that the proxy doesn't have. Or the adapter might be checking if db is an object and has certain properties.
Actually, looking more carefully at the error and the adapter source, the issue is likely that DrizzleAdapter checks if the db parameter is a valid database type. It might be checking the database property or something similar. Our proxy doesn't have these properties at the top level (they're only accessible through the get trap).
Wait, actually the get trap should catch ALL property accesses. If the adapter does db.database or db.someSymbol, the proxy should forward to the real db. The issue might be that the adapter checks typeof db or db.constructor before accessing any properties.
Looking at the actual @auth/drizzle-adapter source would help, but I can't easily do that. Let me try a pragmatic approach:
1. Ensure the proxy looks as much like a real Drizzle database as possible
2. Or, for the auth adapter specifically, use a workaround to avoid the issue
Actually, the validation report says: "A common community workaround is to ensure process.env.DATABASE_URL is available at build time... or to structure imports to defer adapter initialization until runtime."
Let me try the second approach: structure imports to defer adapter initialization. I'll create the auth instance lazily, or I'll make sure the database connection is established before the adapter checks.
Actually, the simplest fix that should work: modify the db proxy to eagerly try to get the real db when the proxy is created (instead of on first property access). This defeats the purpose of the lazy proxy but will fix the build.
Wait, but the lazy proxy exists for a reason - to avoid crashes during build when DATABASE_URL isn't set. If we have DATABASE_URL set in .env.local now, we can safely create the db connection at module evaluation time.
Alternative: I can change the auth/index.ts to not create the adapter during module evaluation. Instead, I'll make it a function that creates the adapter on first access. But NextAuth v5 returns { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } from NextAuth() which is called at module evaluation. And auth/index.ts exports these values, which means NextAuth() is called at module import time.
The only viable solutions are:
1. Eagerly connect the database during module evaluation (defeats lazy proxy)
2. Make the proxy more realistic so the adapter accepts it
Since we now have .env.local with DATABASE_URL set, option 1 is viable. Let me modify db/index.ts to eagerly create the connection:
// Instead of lazy proxy, create eagerly when DATABASE_URL is present
const client = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL!, { ... });
export const db = drizzle(client, { schema, logger: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" });
But this will crash during build if DATABASE_URL is not set. With .env.local in place, it should work. Let me do this. Actually, looking at the validation report again:
"A common community workaround is to ensure DATABASE_URL is available at build time, or to structure imports to defer adapter initialization until runtime."
The recommended fix is to ensure DATABASE_URL is available at build time. We have .env.local now, so the db connection should work. Let me verify by modifying the db/index.ts to not use a proxy, or to eagerly initialize when DATABASE_URL is available.
Actually, the simplest fix: make the proxy eagerly initialize the db if DATABASE_URL is available. Change the db export from a pure proxy to an eagerly-created instance when DATABASE_URL is set during build.
Let me re-read the current db/index.ts to see what makes sense.
→Read src/lib/db/index.ts 
Now I understand the issue. The db proxy is a generic Proxy that only intercepts get operations. When DrizzleAdapter checks the type of db, it might be checking typeof db.database, or calling a method, or checking the prototype chain - any of which the Proxy should handle, but the adapter might be doing something the Proxy can't intercept.
Looking at the session report (F7), the recommended workaround is:
1. Ensure DATABASE_URL is available at build time, or
2. Restructure imports to defer adapter evaluation
Since we have .env.local set up, let me make the proxy more realistic by also intercepting has, ownKeys, and other traps that library code might use. Or, more simply, I can make the proxy also handle Symbol property access which the adapter might be using for type checks.
Actually, the simplest approach: instead of a proxy, eagerly create the db instance when the module is loaded. The lazy proxy was intended for cases where DATABASE_URL is not available at build time, but now that we have .env.local with DATABASE_URL, this is no longer a problem.
Let me modify db/index.ts to eagerly create the db when the module is loaded, but only if DATABASE_URL is set. If not, throw a clear error:
if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error('[DB] DATABASE_URL is not set. Check environment variables.');
}

const client = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ... });
export const db = drizzle(client, { schema, logger: ... });
This is simpler and avoids the proxy complexity entirely. The key risk is that this will crash during build if DATABASE_URL is not set. But since we now have a .env.local file in the project, and Next.js loads it automatically, this should work for dev and build.
Actually, wait - the .env.local is only for development. During CI/CD builds in production, the actual DATABASE_URL would be set. So this is fine.
Let me update db/index.ts to eagerly create the db. This should fix the DrizzleAdapter build error.  The session report confirms the core issue: the proxy doesn't work with DrizzleAdapter which evaluates the database at build time. The recommended workaround is ensuring DATABASE_URL is available at build time (it is via .env.local) and restructuring to avoid lazy proxy issues. Let me fix the database connection to eagerly create the instance:
