    question: "What is the AI Nutrition Label?",
    answer:
      "The AI Nutrition Label is a transparent breakdown of every AI-generated summary we produce. It shows you the model used, the temperature setting, the sources cited, and a confidence score — so you can decide for yourself whether to trust the summary.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are articles summarised?",
    answer:
      "Our system ingests full-text articles, scores them by importance, and queues high-priority stories for AI summarisation. Each summary is validated against its source material and assigned a coverage score.",
  },
  {
    question: "What sources does OneStopNews use?",
    answer:
      "We aggregate from over 200 verified news sources across 7 topic categories. Every source is rated for reliability, and we show you exactly which sources contributed to each summary.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data private?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We do not sell your data or share it with third parties. Your reading habits are encrypted at rest and we comply with the EU AI Act Article 50 disclosure requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the EU AI Act affect the summaries?",
    answer:
      "The EU AI Act Article 50 requires transparent disclosure when AI generates content. Our 3-layer provenance system (JSON-LD, HTTP header, HTML meta) ensures compliance at every touchpoint.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I contribute a source?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Contact us at sources@onestop.news with the RSS feed or API endpoint you would like us to include. We review all submissions for editorial integrity before adding them to our ingestion pipeline.",
