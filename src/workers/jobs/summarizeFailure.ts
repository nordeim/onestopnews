 * AI failure. This makes failed summaries visible in the admin review queue
 * instead of silently leaving them as 'none' (which allows infinite retry
 * and provides no observability).

 * Extracted as a pure function for testability — the processSummarizeJob
 * catch block calls this to determine the correct failure state.
